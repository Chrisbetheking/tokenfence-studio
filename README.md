## Overview

**TokenFence Studio** is a local-first AI workspace that sits between users and large language models.

It is not trying to be just another chat UI. The main idea is to build a small pre-LLM layer that can inspect, clean, protect, chunk, and route user input before it reaches a model.

```
Raw prompt / uploaded files
    -> Document Intelligence Pipeline
    -> Prompt Guard + Redaction
    -> Intent detection
    -> Context compression
    -> Model Matrix / file-level routing
    -> Final prompt preview
    -> LLM provider or local model
```

The goal is to make LLM usage safer, cleaner, and easier to debug.

---

## Why TokenFence?

Most AI tools focus on model access.

TokenFence Studio focuses on what happens **before** model access:

- Does this prompt contain secrets or private data?
- Can this PDF, DOCX, log, or Markdown file be cleaned first?
- Can noisy headers, page numbers, and repeated text be removed?
- Can the document be turned into RAG-ready chunks?
- Which model should handle this task or file?
- Should this file go to a cloud model, a local model, or a safer redacted workflow?
- Can several models be compared side by side?

That makes TokenFence closer to a **pre-LLM safety and orchestration layer** than a normal ChatGPT-style interface.

UI screenshots will be added after the next stable release.

## Core Features

### Prompt Guard
Scan prompts locally before they are sent to a model. Detects API keys, emails, phone numbers, database URLs, access tokens, secret assignments, Chinese personal identifiers, and credential-like leaks.

### Redaction Engine
Replace detected sensitive values with safe placeholders while keeping the task understandable.

### Document Intelligence Pipeline
Turn uploaded or pasted files into clean, safe, model-ready context:
- PDF text extraction (text-based PDFs)
- DOCX raw text extraction
- Local image OCR through Tesseract.js
- Noise cleaning and RAG-ready chunk generation
- Export as Markdown / JSON

### Model Matrix
Send the same prompt to multiple models, compare responses, latency, token usage, and risk status. Route each file separately when processing multiple files.

### File-level Model Routing
Different files get different models based on type and risk. Coding files go to coding models, secrets go to local models, long documents get long-context models.

### Multi-provider Support
Supports global, China-based, router, and local providers. Bring your own API key. No vendor lock-in.

Current presets: OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Volcengine/Doubao, Alibaba/Qwen, Baidu Qianfan, Kimi/Moonshot, Zhipu GLM, MiniMax, SiliconFlow, OpenRouter, Groq, Together AI, 302.AI, ModelScope, Ollama, LM Studio, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

### Context Compression
Compress long prompts or document context while keeping the user goal, constraints, and important details.

### Local Archive
Store sanitized runs locally. No cloud database required.

### Agent Context Packs
Prepare reusable context bundles for AI coding and agent workflows.

### Shared TypeScript Package
Cross-platform logic in `packages/shared` -- guard scanning, provider presets, file routing, fallback chains, budget routing, citation panel.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Web | Available now | Full Next.js workspace |
| Android | Available now | Expo React Native Mobile Lite. APK available from GitHub Releases. |
| Windows Desktop | Experimental | Tauri wrapper, packaging in progress |
| macOS Desktop | Experimental | Tauri wrapper, packaging in progress |

---

## Quick Start

### Web Workspace

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chrisbetheking/tokenfence-studio.git
cd tokenfence-studio
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Android Mobile Lite

```bash
cd apps/android
npm install
npm run start
```

Scan the QR code with Expo Go, or connect an Android device / emulator.

### Desktop App

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm install
npm run dev
```

Requires Rust and Tauri CLI. See [docs/RELEASES.md](./docs/RELEASES.md).

### API Keys

Create a `.env.local` file or save keys in the Provider settings page.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
VOLCENGINE_API_KEY=
DASHSCOPE_API_KEY=
QIANFAN_API_KEY=
MOONSHOT_API_KEY=
ZHIPU_API_KEY=
MINIMAX_API_KEY=
SILICONFLOW_API_KEY=
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY=
TOGETHER_API_KEY=
THREE_ZERO_TWO_API_KEY=
MODELSCOPE_API_KEY=
```

If you only use Ollama or LM Studio, cloud API keys are optional.
