## How Releases Are Built

Releases are triggered by pushing a version tag:

```bash
git tag v0.6.0
git push origin v0.6.0
```

The `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow runs automatically and produces:
- Web build artifacts
- Android APK (via Expo EAS, with --wait and artifact download)
- Desktop app bundles (Windows + macOS via Tauri -- experimental)

## Desktop

The desktop app is evolving from a simple Tauri web wrapper into a dedicated renderer:

- **Current**: `apps/desktop/ui/` contains a Vite + React + TypeScript desktop UI
- **Config**: `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` points to the Vite output
- **Shared**: Reuses logic from `packages/shared`

### Prerequisites (local build)

- Rust (for Tauri)
- Node.js 18-22
- Tauri CLI

### Build locally

```bash
cd apps/desktop
npm run ui:install
npm run build
```
